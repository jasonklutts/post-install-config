Departments manage ticket organization and routing.  
They provide structure, access control, automation, reporting, and autoresponses.

Teams complement Departments by managing collaboration across them.  
They provide:
- Cross-department collaboration  
- Granular agent assignment  
- Permission & access management  
- Workload distribution  

---

### Step 4: Configure Users
<img width="823" height="526" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29f6a72c-e040-408f-a6e0-051ae90c1055" />


Users are the individuals creating support tickets (customers/clients).  
They can submit requests, track status, receive notifications, and maintain profiles.  

---

### Step 5: Configure Agents
<img width="826" height="588" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99a2e936-c796-4c12-b6f3-c7bd060d7368" />

Agents (staff) respond to and manage tickets.  
Their functions include:
- Responding to tickets  
- Ticket management  
- User support & communication  
- Permissions & access control  
- Internal collaboration  

---

### Step 6: Set Up SLAs

Service Level Agreements define response and resolution deadlines.  
They ensure accountability and customer satisfaction through:
- Time-based expectations  
- Prioritization  
- Automation & escalation  
- Performance tracking

---

### Step 7: Create Help Topics
<img width="824" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/737b62db-4cbe-472f-8d78-f572cdc2441b" />

Help Topics categorize incoming tickets for better workflow automation.  
They improve ticket organization and routing, providing:
- Categorization  
- Automated handling  
- Custom user experience  
- Escalation and routing  
- Reporting & metrics
